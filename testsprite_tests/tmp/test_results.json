    "testError": "Summary of verification attempt and findings:\n\n- User request: Verify creating a new journal entry (text + rich media: images, sketches). Generate/execute tests for TC001, TC003, TC004 and complete the sequence of 7 steps (navigate to journal screen, click Create New Entry, add text, insert image, add sketch, save entry, assert saved).\n\n- What was attempted:\n  1) Navigated to http://localhost:3000 (3 times).  \n  2) Opened the same URL in a new browser tab (1 time).  \n  3) Waited to allow SPA load (3s then 5s).  \n  4) Performed controlled reloads (go_to_url) totaling 3 reloads.  \n  5) Scrolled the page to attempt revealing hidden UI (1 time).  \n  6) Re-checked for interactive elements after each attempt.\n\n- Observed results:\n  - The page remained blank (white) on every attempt. Screenshot shows an empty white page. \n  - No interactive elements were detected (0 links, 0 inputs, 0 buttons, 0 iframes). \n  - Because the SPA did not render, none of the required journal creation steps could be executed. \n  - Tests were not executed; 0 of 7 test steps completed.\n\n- Diagnostic summary (facts only):\n  - SPA did not render within the test environment at http://localhost:3000.\n  - Multiple navigation and recovery attempts produced the same blank result.\n  - No page-level UI elements were available for interaction.\n\n- Recommended next steps for remediation (actions for the user/team):\n  1) Confirm that the Flutter web server / frontend dev server is running and serving at port 3000. Restart the dev server if necessary.\n     - Example (if Flutter web): run the appropriate Flutter/web dev command used in this project (e.g., flutter run -d web-server --web-hostname=0.0.0.0 --web-port=3000 OR the project's documented start command).\n  2) Provide browser console logs and network requests for the page load (client console errors or failing network calls often explain a blank SPA).\n  3) Verify there are no CSP or CORS issues preventing resources from loading.  \n  4) If a different URL or port serves the app (staging/test), provide that URL so tests can resume.  \n  5) If the environment requires authentication or a different startup routine, provide test credentials or the startup steps.\n\n- What remains to complete the original verification once the app is reachable:\n  - Navigate to the journal management screen.  \n  - Click 'Create New Entry'.  \n  - Add sample text content to the entry.  \n  - Insert an image (validate supported formats and upload flow).  \n  - Add a sketch (validate drawing/canvas integration).  \n  - Save the entry.  \n  - Assert that the entry appears in the list with visible text and media.\n  - Generate/execute Flutter widget/integration tests (TC001, TC003, TC004) once the UI is available.\n\n- Current completion status: NOT completed. All verification steps blocked by blank SPA. \n\nIf preferred, provide the requested frontend logs or start/restart instructions and the agent can be re-run (or tests re-attempted) once the app is reachable. Also available: produce the requested Flutter widget/integration test code (TC001/TC003/TC004) offline and deliver it now; these tests will be runnable once the app is accessible. Specify preference.\n",
